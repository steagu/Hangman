# Hangman project

This is a simple command-line Hangman game. The main file is Hangman.cpp, and it depends on words-alpha to work.

I first built this program as an assignment in my freshman year of college, but since I had a lot of fun with it, 
I've gone back and adjusted it many times over the years. It is now very different from its original design, and
every time that I open it, I end up refactoring something. 

I plan to add a level select feature at some point in the future, and to add unit tests
